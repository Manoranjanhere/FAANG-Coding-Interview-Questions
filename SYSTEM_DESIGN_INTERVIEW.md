## Key Complexity Factors for System Design Interviews

When preparing for these system design problems, focus on these key aspects that determine their complexity:

1. **Scale**: How many users/requests must the system handle?
2. **Availability**: What level of uptime is required?
3. **Consistency**: What consistency model is needed (eventual vs. strong)?
4. **Latency**: What are the response time requirements?
5. **Data Storage**: What volume and type of data must be managed?
6. **Security**: What security considerations are critical?

## Interview Tips for System Design

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Begin by asking questions to understand exactly what you need to design.
2. **Define Scope**: Establish what's in and out of scope for the discussion.
3. **High-Level Architecture**: Start with a high-level design before diving into details.
4. **Focus on Trade-offs**: Discuss the pros and cons of your design choices.
5. **Consider Scale**: Always think about how your system would scale to millions of users.
6. **Data Model**: Define a clear data model with appropriate relationships.
7. **Be Pragmatic**: Use existing technologies and patterns rather than inventing new ones.

## Company-Specific Focus Areas

- **Google**: Search systems, distributed computing, scalability
- **Meta**: Social networks, content delivery, real-time systems
- **Amazon**: E-commerce, inventory systems, recommendation engines
- **Microsoft**: Enterprise software, collaboration tools, cloud infrastructure
